# futoshiki_Solver
Futoshiki solver implemented in Python using backtracking and forward checking


In order to run my project simply call main and pass in the name of the file that contains the initial board along with the horizontal and vertical inequalities. 
In order for my code to work the naming convention of files passed in must follow the following convention: Input + # + .txt. 
This is just like the test input files we were given, i.e. Input1.txt, Input2.txt, Input3.txt. 
This is because I use the number to automatically generate an output file with the same number. 
Lastly, the recursion limit is sometimes hit on the Input3.txt file given so it is necessary to re-run the program to get the correct output
